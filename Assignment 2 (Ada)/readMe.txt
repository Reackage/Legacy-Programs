rbreak


Assignment 2: Ada programing(maze)


To run this program, compile
gnatemake rbreaka2.adb 
and then,
rbreaka2.exe

Instructions:
Max maze size is 98 by 98, leaving a slot for buffering the files. 

You will be asked to give a file name. That file must be formated with all the columbs starting on a new line and must all
be the same length, otherwise unintened crashes might occur. The maze must be surrounded by a wall indicator"*". The file
will be checked for a start and exit ("o" and "e", respectively).

The program will then print to the screen the maze it read, and then the solution path to the maze, as well as the coordinates
of the path it took.
